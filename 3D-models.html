        <!--The origin: The first rifles appeared in Europe during the early modern period, in the 16th century, although there were exceedingly few of them.
During the Vietnam War, the Soviet Union supplied a substantial quantity of rifles to Vietnam in support of our cause. Prior to the insanity of the US's and Diem's operation, Vietnamese soldiers employed weapons against the enemy.
Advantages: This gun is quite dependable and seldom gets misplaced or jammed during usage; also, this rifle could shoot readily whether coated with a great deal of dust, sand, dirt, water, or when used in harsh conditions.
Disadvantages: Despite being a semiautomatic rifle, this weapon might have an inadvertent machine fire event, as it only shoots one shot at a time.

        <!--The origin: 6 July 1947. It marks the day the Soviet assault weapon AK-47 was born.
Due to its appropriateness to Vietnam's climate, this weapon was one of the most commonly utilised weapons during the Vietnam War against the United States. Another reason is that the AK-47 is affordable, therefore Vietnamese troops do not need to be competent in order to repair it if it fails.
Advantages: The AK-47 is without a doubt the most effective weapon ever created, since it enables a man, woman, or child to execute another human with the least level of skill, training, and expense. In addition, this weapon is sturdy, seldom jams, and the Vietnamese soldiers could make it operate even if it was submerged for months in a river or muck.
Disadvantages: Low muzzle velocity of the comparatively hefty 7.62mm cartridge is the most significant shortcoming of the AK-47. This leads in a looping trajectory, which necessitates a cumbersome correction for accuracy at ranges exceeding 300 metres.

        <!--The origin: In 1936, Canadian designer John Garand created the world's first semi automatic gun.
It is never a single characteristic that makes a gun exceptional, but a combination of features and timing. The M1 rifle was the ideal weapon at the ideal time. In a world dominated by bolt-action firearms, its semi-automatic design was undeniably advantageous.
Advantages: The gun's unique firing mechanism enables it to attain more accuracy than comparable weapons. Another advantageous feature of this weapon is its rapid reloading, which facilitates its employment by warriors during fighting.
Disadvantages: Due to its construction, the M1 Garand is extremely heavy and demands a great amount of experience and training to use. Another issue that soldiers encounter while utilising this type of weapon is that its upkeep is quite complex.

        <!--The origin: The first Boeing Vertol CH-47A Chinook rotorcraft was delivered to the U.S. Army on August 16, 1962.
In 1965, the 1st Air Cavalry Division of the United States deployed to Vietnam and manned a CH-47 aircraft battalion. One of the primary responsibilities of CH - 47 aircraft during the Vietnam War was to transfer artillery to high sites and assure their ammo supply.
Advantages: For decades, the CH-47 has demonstrated its dependability and effectiveness. Chinook operations have spanned the world, from cold climes to tropical jungles. In addition, this helicopter could readily transport massive products such as armoured trucks.
Disadvantages: The CH-47's most glaring flaw is that when one of its two engines fails, the aircraft virtually loses control of itself in the air, making it challenging for pilots to maintain balance with only one engine.

        <!--TThe origin: The M48 Patton is a first-generation main battle tank (MBT) made in America that was released in February 1952.
The US army extensively imported a sizable quantity of M48 pattons into Vietnam in 1970 and progressively handed them to the former Saigon administration in order to expand the number of combat transportations. To replace the Americans in committing atrocities on the Vietnamese people, they outfitted the Nguy. 
Advantages: The M48 has infrared night vision goggles and can traverse slopes up to 31 degree, wade 1.40 metres deep, and cross a 2.76 metre wide moat.
Disadvantages: The main issues with this M48 were its delayed service entrance and a range finder that was fairly difficult to use. Furthermore, it needed ongoing training and expertise.

        <!--The origin: The Italians utilised powered aircraft for the first time in combat against the Turks in Tripoli in 1911, but it was not until the Great War of 1914â€“18 that their use expanded widely.
Bombers, which are military aircraft, were intended to drop bombs on specific targets. This type of conveyance may hold up to 60 kilograms (130 pounds) of small bombs, and all the observer had do is pick it up and drop it over the edge.
Advantages: Due to the fact that this aircraft was meant to carry bombs and other weapons, it can carry a great deal of weight and it is simple to control the explosives inside.
Disadvantages: A further issue with the design is that the entrance and exit doors are rather narrow, making escape by soldiers using parachutes extremely hazardous.

        <!--The origin: The unsuccessful Mk I of 1917 was replaced by the Mk II in 1918, and it was standardised in 1920. The Mk II was redesignated the Mk 2 on 2 April 1945.
This is a kind of ammunition used against infantry with medium penetration strength and a squeeze-and-recoil mechanism.
Advantages: One of the greatest benefits of this equipment is that it weighs only 500 grams and is suitable for throwing.
Disadvantages: Due to the fact that the explosive duration is so short - only 3.5 seconds , it would be extremely risky for soldiers to utilise this weapon without prior training.

        <!--This is one of the most valuable pieces of equipment for Vietnamese soldiers, allowing them to see their enemies clearly from a distance so they can easily manage and plan their attacks. In particular, the binoculars may be of great use to the soldiers during night warfare, as they could search for dangerous creatures to avoid while standing watch in the forest and prevent the enemy attacks.
With a design that enables the military to view appropriately oriented left-to-right and in a natural way with both eyes, soldiers might feel more at ease than when using single telescopes. Moreover, it increases visual acuity and gives depth perception by providing the human visual system with two sets of data to evaluate and integrate.

        <!--One of the essential supplies was a water bottle, which allowed the soldiers to carry enough water to quench their thirst even when marching through dense woodlands devoid of lakes. Particularly under harsh situations, soldiers may feel thirsty and become ill quickly; therefore, drinking water might make them feel better and prevent them from getting faint. 
With its war-specific design, this bottle could store hot or cold water for up to 12 hours, allowing the soldier to set the water's temperature.
