                    <h3>AK47</h3>
                    <p><b>The origin</b>: 6 July 1947. It marks the day the Soviet assault weapon AK-47 was born.
                        Due to its appropriateness to Vietnam's climate, this weapon was one of the most commonly utilised weapons during the Vietnam War against the United States. Another reason is that the AK-47 is affordable, therefore Vietnamese troops do not need to be competent in order to repair it if it fails.<br><br>
                    <b>Advantages</b>: The AK-47 is without a doubt the most effective weapon ever created, since it enables a man, woman, or child to execute another human with the least level of skill, training, and expense. In addition, this weapon is sturdy, seldom jams, and the Vietnamese soldiers could make it operate even if it was submerged for months in a river or muck.<br><br>
                    <b>Disadvantages</b>: Low muzzle velocity of the comparatively hefty 7.62mm cartridge is the most significant shortcoming of the AK-47. This leads in a looping trajectory, which necessitates a cumbersome correction for accuracy at ranges exceeding 300 metres.</p>

                    <h3>M1 Garand ( US Rifle, Caliber .30, M1)</h3>
                    <p><b>The origin</b>: In 1936, Canadian designer John Garand created the world's first semi automatic gun.
                        It is never a single characteristic that makes a gun exceptional, but a combination of features and timing. The M1 rifle was the ideal weapon at the ideal time. In a world dominated by bolt-action firearms, its semi-automatic design was undeniably advantageous.<br><br>
                    <b>Advantages</b>: The gun's unique firing mechanism enables it to attain more accuracy than comparable weapons. Another advantageous feature of this weapon is its rapid reloading, which facilitates its employment by warriors during fighting.<br><br>
                    <b>Disadvantages</b>: Due to its construction, the M1 Garand is extremely heavy and demands a great amount of experience and training to use. Another issue that soldiers encounter while utilising this type of weapon is that its upkeep is quite complex.</p>
