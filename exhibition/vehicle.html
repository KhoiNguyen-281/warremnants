                    <h3>CH-47 Chinook</h3>
                    <p><b>The origin</b>: The first Boeing Vertol CH-47A Chinook rotorcraft was delivered to the U.S. Army on August 16, 1962.
                        In 1965, the 1st Air Cavalry Division of the United States deployed to Vietnam and manned a CH-47 aircraft battalion. One of the primary responsibilities of CH - 47 aircraft during the Vietnam War was to transfer artillery to high sites and assure their ammo supply.<br><br>
                    <b>Advantages</b>: For decades, the CH-47 has demonstrated its dependability and effectiveness. Chinook operations have spanned the world, from cold climes to tropical jungles. In addition, this helicopter could readily transport massive products such as armoured trucks.<br><br>
                    <b>Disadvantages</b>: The CH-47's most glaring flaw is that when one of its two engines fails, the aircraft virtually loses control of itself in the air, making it challenging for pilots to maintain balance with only one engine.</p>

                    <h3>The M48 Patton</h3>
                    <p><b>The origin</b>: The M48 Patton is a first-generation main battle tank (MBT) made in America that was released in February 1952.
                        The US army extensively imported a sizable quantity of M48 pattons into Vietnam in 1970 and progressively handed them to the former Saigon administration in order to expand the number of combat transportations. To replace the Americans in committing atrocities on the Vietnamese people, they outfitted the Nguy.<br><br>
                    <b>Advantages</b>: The M48 has infrared night vision goggles and can traverse slopes up to 31 degree, wade 1.40 metres deep, and cross a 2.76 metre wide moat.<br><br>
                    <b>Disadvantages</b>: The main issues with this M48 were its delayed service entrance and a range finder that was fairly difficult to use. Furthermore, it needed ongoing training and expertise.</p>

                    <h3>Bomber</h3>
                    <p><b>The origin</b>: The Italians utilised powered aircraft for the first time in combat against the Turks in Tripoli in 1911, but it was not until the Great War of 1914â€“18 that their use expanded widely.
                        Bombers, which are military aircraft, were intended to drop bombs on specific targets. This type of conveyance may hold up to 60 kilograms (130 pounds) of small bombs, and all the observer had do is pick it up and drop it over the edge.<br><br>
                    <b>Advantages</b>: Due to the fact that this aircraft was meant to carry bombs and other weapons, it can carry a great deal of weight and it is simple to control the explosives inside.<br><br>
                    <b>Disadvantages</b>: A further issue with the design is that the entrance and exit doors are rather narrow, making escape by soldiers using parachutes extremely hazardous.</p>
